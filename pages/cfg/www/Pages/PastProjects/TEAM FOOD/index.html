    <b>INGREDIENTS:</b> 4-6 very ripe tomatoes, 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, salt + pepper, 1 crushed garlic clove,3 sprigs thyme leaves,8 slices ciabatta, 150g plain cottage cheese, squeeze of lemon juice + zest, handful basil leaves.
    <P></P>
    <P><b>METHOD:</B> Prepare the tomatoes first. Peel the tomatoes by making a cross-cut at the base of each one and place in a bowl. Cover with boiling water and leave for one minute. Remove the tomatoes from the water and slip the skins off. Finely chop the flesh and place in a bowl.</P>
<P>Add the oil, a generous amount of seasoning, garlic and thyme and leave to macerate for at least 15 minutes or as long as you can – the salt will draw out the juices and mingle with the oil and make a really delicious dressing.</P>
<P>Griddle the bread on a griddle or toast until golden and crisp. Place the cottage cheese in a bowl and whisk in the oil and seasoning. Squeeze in a little lemon juice and add a little zest to lift the flavours and set aside. Spoon the tomatoes generously onto the toast and scatter with torn up basil leaves. Spoon the cottage cheese on top and serve with napkins.</P>

     <b>INGREDIENTS:</b>2 cups red lentils, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 diced onion, 2 tsp salt, 8 minced garlic cloves, 4 diced carrots, 1 tsp cracked pepper, 1/4 tsp chili flakes, 1 tbsp oregano, 1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary, 2 bay leaves, 8 cups of vegetable stock, 1/2 lemon zest +juice of 2 lemons, 1 cup crumbled feta cheese, 2 tsp minced rosemary, cracked pepper to taste.
    <P></P>
    <P><b>METHOD:</b>Start by rinsing the lentils in a colander under running water. Set aside to drain. Heat the olive oil in a large pot and add onions and sauté until translucent. Add carrots, garlic, salt, pepper, chili flakes, 1 tbsp. rosemary, oregano and bay leaves. Stir well and sauté until carrots are tender.</P>
<P>Add the stock and the lentils and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer partially covered, until the lentils are soft and have broken apart (around 20-25 minutes).Remove the bay leaves. Decide at this point if you would like to puree the soup or not. I like to leave mine chunky.</P>
<P>Season the soup with lemon zest and lemon juice. Decide if more salt and pepper is needed.To serve, combine the feta cheese, 1 tsp minced rosemary and fresh cracked pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle over hot bowls of soup and enjoy.</P>
